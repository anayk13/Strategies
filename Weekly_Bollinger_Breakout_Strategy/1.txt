Strategy Name: Weekly Bollinger Breakout with 200 MA Exit

1. Objective

This strategy aims to capture strong upward breakouts on weekly charts by entering when price closes above the upper Bollinger Band and exiting only when long-term weakness is confirmed via the 200-period moving average.

2. Indicators Used

Bollinger Bands (50,2):

Based on a 50-period simple moving average (weekly).

Upper Band = SMA(50) + (2 Ã— standard deviation of last 50 closes).

Lower Band = SMA(50) â€“ (2 Ã— standard deviation of last 50 closes).

Purpose: Detect volatility breakouts beyond the normal range.

200-period Moving Average (200 MA):

Based on the last 200 weekly closes.

Purpose: Acts as a long-term trend filter and risk management exit trigger.

3. Entry Rule (Buy)

Condition: If the weekly closing price > upper Bollinger Band (50,2).

Action: Enter a long position at the next candle (or at close, depending on execution rules).

Rationale: A close above the upper band indicates strong bullish momentum breaking beyond normal volatility.

4. Exit Rule (Sell)

Condition: If the weekly closing price < 200-period moving average.

Action: Exit the existing long position.

Rationale: A close below the 200 MA indicates long-term weakness and trend reversal risk.

5. Position Management

One position at a time.

No pyramiding (adding more after entry).

Stay flat until a fresh Buy condition is met again.
