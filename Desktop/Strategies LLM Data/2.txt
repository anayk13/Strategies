Strategy Name: Top-3 12-Month Momentum Stocks

Purpose: Identify the strongest-performing stocks over the past year.

Holding Period:

Fixed at 3 months after entry.

Purpose: Limit exposure and lock in momentum gains.

3. Entry Rule (Buy)

At the start of each 3-month cycle:

Rank all eligible stocks by their trailing 12-month returns.

Select the top 3 stocks with the highest returns.

Buy these stocks at the current market price (or next available open).

Rationale: Stocks with strong past performance tend to continue trending upward over the short term (momentum effect).

4. Exit Rule (Sell)

Sell all positions exactly 3 months after purchase, regardless of performance.

Rationale: Avoid overexposure to momentum reversals; this also allows a rebalancing cycle.

5. Position Management

Equal-weight allocation to all three selected stocks.

No new positions until the next 3-month cycle.

During the holding period:

No additional buys in the same stock.

Avoid reinvesting in the same stock until the next cycle.

6. Backtesting / Live Execution Logic

The strategy follows a time-cycle-based flow:

Cycle Initialization (Every 3 Months):

Calculate trailing 12-month returns for all eligible stocks.

Rank stocks and select top 3.

Buy selected stocks at market price.

Holding Period (3 Months):

Maintain positions; ignore short-term fluctuations.

Cycle End:

Sell all positions.

Record entry/exit dates, prices, and profits/losses.

Performance Metrics to Evaluate:

CAGR (annualized return).

Maximum drawdown.

Win rate (percentage of profitable cycles).

Average return per cycle.

Sharpe ratio / risk-adjusted return.
