Strategy Name: Gap-Up + Bollinger Band Exit

1. Objective

This strategy aims to capture short-term profit opportunities and protect gains by selling stocks that exhibit strong upward price spikes (gap-ups) combined with being overextended relative to recent volatility (above upper Bollinger Band).

2. Indicators / Metrics Used

Gap-Up Detection:

Condition: Todayâ€™s Open > Previous Close.

Purpose: Identify stocks that start the day significantly higher than the prior dayâ€™s close, signaling potential overbought conditions or profit-taking opportunities.

Bollinger Bands (50,2):

Upper Band = 50-period SMA + 2 Ã— standard deviation of the last 50 closes.

Condition: Current price > upper Bollinger Band.

Purpose: Detect overextension and high volatility breakout areas.

3. Entry Rule (Sell / Exit)

Condition: If stock opens gap up AND the current price is above the upper Bollinger Band, then:

Sell (or short, depending on the strategy) at market price.

Rationale:

A gap-up above the upper Bollinger Band often indicates overbought conditions.

This is a profit-taking / risk management signal, reducing exposure when the stock may reverse.

4. Position Management

Apply to all open long positions.

Only trigger once per stock per signal.

If the stock doesnâ€™t meet the condition, continue holding.

Can be combined with other strategies (e.g., momentum holding or trend-following) for dynamic risk management.

5. Backtesting / Live Execution Logic

The strategy follows a daily-check flow:

For each trading day:

Calculate previous dayâ€™s close.

Calculate 50-period SMA and upper Bollinger Band.

Check if:

Todayâ€™s Open > Previous Close (gap-up)

Todayâ€™s Open (or High) > Upper Bollinger Band

If both conditions are met â†’ Sell.

Position Tracking:

Maintain a record of which stocks were sold, at what price, and when.

Helps in analyzing effectiveness of gap-up exits over time.

Performance Metrics to Evaluate:

Profit per signal.

Reduction in drawdown compared to holding all longs.

Win rate of gap-up + upper BB sell signals.

Average reversal after signal.
